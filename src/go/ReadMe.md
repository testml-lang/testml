testml-js
=========

This branch of the TestML repository is for making the NodeJS npm module.

## Instructions

This branch needs to be a worktree directory called `node` under the master
working directory. It has symlinks that point back to files in master.

Run this command to create a directory called `npm` that has the files to be
published to npmjs.org.
```
make clean npm
```
